# Nashville Waterways E. coli Predictive Modeling Project

This project currently provides a modelled prediction of waterborne harmful microbial concentration at one river site in Nashville, with plans to expand the model to
include other sites on the Hapreth river and Mill Creek. Conventional water quality sampling can only provide readings from the past couple of days, which is inadequate
for the purposes of advising recreational usage. Real time data are retrieved from USGS and local weather stations to make predictions based on a model built from past
E. coli samples and environmental conditions, and updated on an hourly basis with github actions on the project website hosted with github pages.
